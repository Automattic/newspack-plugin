# GA4 connector

This connector listens to some events of the Data API and sends them to Google Analytics 4

## Setting up

For now, the credentials must be manually added to the database. You will need your measurement ID and an API secret.

* api_secret - Required. An API SECRET generated in the Google Analytics UI. To create a new secret, navigate to:
    Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement Protocol > Create
* measurement_id - Required. The measurement ID associated with a stream. Found in the Google Analytics UI under:
    Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement ID

Store this info in the database:
```
wp option set ga4_measurement_id "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
wp option set ga4_measurement_protocol_secret YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
```
