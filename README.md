The Newspack plugin provides tools and guidance for setting up and managing the important features and plugins a modern newsroom needs.

Newspack is an open-source publishing platform built on WordPress for small to medium sized news organizations. It is an “opinionated” platform that stakes out clear, best-practice positions on technology, design, and business practice for news publishers.

## How to install Newspack on your site

If you'd like to install Newspack on your self-hosted site or want to try Newspack out, the easiest way to do so is to [download the latest plugin release](https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-plugin/releases) and [the latest theme release](https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-theme/releases). Upload them using the plugin or theme installer in your WordPress admin interface. To take full advantage of Newspack, the plugin and theme should be run together, but each should also work fine individually.
